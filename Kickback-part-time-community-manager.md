## About Kickback

Kickback (https://kickback.events) is an Ethereum-based event management service that delivers higher event participation rates by asking registrants to put some skin in the game.
Everyone commits a small amount of ETH when they RSVP, which is refunded after the event check-in. Any no-shows lose their ETH, which can then be split amongst the attendees.
We have been a part of the Status Incubate accelerator program, have hosted various events during DevCon4 in Prague with nearly 500 participants, and are now ready to open up our platform to Ethereum organisers around the world.
We need your help in welcoming event organisers and helping them run their events successfully using our platform.
This is an exciting opportunity to join our team as a first hire and have a chance to grow with the company from the very early stages.
